# Graph with Floyd Warshall and MST

**Project Description:**

This C++ project, implements functionality for managing weighted graphs, computing the transitive closure, calculating the cheapest cost between vertices, and finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm. The main components of the project include:

- **WGraph**: Represents a weighted graph and provides methods for adding/removing edges, computing transitive closure, and finding the MST.
- **VertexSetCollection**: Manages sets of vertices, particularly used in finding the MST.
- **FileProcessor**: Handles input/output operations, reads input data from a file, constructs a weighted graph, computes its MST, and writes the MST details to an output file.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
